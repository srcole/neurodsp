A package of tools to simulat and analyze neural time series, focused on time and frequency domain analyses.

## Documentation

Documentation for the NeuroDSP module is available [here](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/).

The documentation also includes a full set of [tutorials](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/auto_tutorials/index.html)
covering the functionality of NeuroDSP.

If you have a question about using NeuroDSP that doesn't seem to be covered by the documentation, feel free to
open an [issue](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp/issues) and ask!

## Dependencies

NeuroDSP is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.5 to run.

It has the following dependencies:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- pytest (optional)

We recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution to manage these requirements.

## Modules

Available modules in NeuroDSP include:

- ```filt``` : Filter data with bandpass, highpass, lowpass, or notch filters
- ```burst``` : Detect bursting oscillations in neural signals
- ```rhythm``` : Find and analyze rhythmic and recurrent patterns in time series
- ```spectral``` : Compute spectral domain features such as power spectra
- ```timefrequency``` : Estimate instantaneous measures of oscillatory activity
- ```sim``` : Simulate time series, including periodic and aperiodic signal components
- ```plts``` : Plotting functions
